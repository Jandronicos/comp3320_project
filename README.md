# Farmlife: GOTY Edition

## Dependencies
You will need Visual Studio and up to date GPU drivers with OpenGL implementation to run this. 

## Description

This project will result in a 3D scene with some actors that may be equipped with some simple animations and allow a user to navigate the space to experience our creation. The scene will depict a farm, might have a building and some animals with some general basic terrain. The minimally viable deliverable is a basic scene with some models and lighting that covers a few of the more advanced techniques of 3D graphics rendering Once this has been achieved we may aim to implement some physics and collision with animations to our actors to create a more interactive experience. We also may add in particle effects, more advanced shadows, water, and reflections depending on how well the project progresses.
